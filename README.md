# Configuring Remote State in Terraform

Transition from a local Terraform state file to a remote state backend in Azure Blob Storage. This setup is essential for collaborative infrastructure management, ensuring that the state is safely stored and accessible by the entire team.

## Prerequisites

To complete this task, you must have Terraform and Azure CLI installed and configured on your machine.

## Steps to Complete the Task

**1. Fork this Repository**

**2. Set Up Local Backend**

- Ensure that the initial `main.tf` file includes a basic setup for the local backend.
- Initialize Terraform to use the local backend.

**3. Transition to Remote State Backend**

- Modify `main.tf` to configure the remote backend in Azure.
- Create necessary Azure resources for the backend configuration.
- Apply the configuration to create the necessary Azure resources.
- Initialize Terraform with the new backend configuration, migrating the state from local to remote.

**4. Verify the Remote State Configuration**

- Run Terraform plan and apply commands to verify the setup.
- Check the Azure Blob Storage to ensure the `terraform.tfstate` file is stored there.
